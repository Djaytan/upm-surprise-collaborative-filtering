Program is run by executing ```python3 main.py [arg1] [arg2]```

**Exercise 1**<br>
**a)** the command to run the solution for exercise 1a is : ```python3 main.py e1 .25``` <br>
This calculates and plots the optimal value for k with a sparcity of .25<br><br>
**b)** for exercise 1b it is : ```python3 main.py e1 .75``` <br>
This calculates and plots the optimal value for k with a sparcity of .75<br>

**Exercise 2**<br>
The Command for exercise 2 is ```python3 main.py e2```

To compare the MAE values of SVD and KNN run the cmmand ```python3 main.py compare```

**Exercise 3**<br>
The command for exercise 3 is ```python3 main.py e3 KNN``` to calculate all values for the KNN algorithm<br>
The command ```python3 main.py e3 SVD``` calculates for the SVD algorithm
